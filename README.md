This is a public GitHub repo managed by members of the Powell Lab at the Garvan Institute, to collect and share resources for common computational challenges.

The resources are organised as follows:

* [R tricks and cheatseets](R_tricks.md) is a collection of useful tricks in the R language to either facilitate or speed up tasks
